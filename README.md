# ðŸš€ C++ Project Base Learning

A structured roadmap of **system-level and networking projects** in C++.  
From beginner-level socket programming to building mini distributed systems, RPC, proxies, and even operating system components.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Progression Path

> **Basic sockets** â†’ **Protocols** â†’ **Concurrency & OS internals** â†’ **Frameworks (HTTP/gRPC)** â†’ **Distributed Systems**

---

## ðŸ“š Tiers Overview

- ðŸ”¹ **Tier 1: Beginner** â€” Warm-ups, sockets, basic threads, CLI tools
- ðŸ”¸ **Tier 2: Intermediate** â€” Multithreading, custom protocols, memory allocators
- ðŸ”¶ **Tier 3: Advanced** â€” Asynchronous I/O, load balancers, distributed KV stores
- ðŸŸ¦ **Tier 4: Expert** â€” Protocol implementations, distributed coordination, OS concepts
- ðŸŸ¥ **Tier 5: Mastery** â€” High-performance systems, CDN, tracing, distributed databases
